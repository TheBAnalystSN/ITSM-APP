## Backend Reflection

During this project, I built a backend API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. One of the main challenges was implementing secure authentication using JWT and ensuring routes were properly protected.

I learned how to structure an Express application using controllers, routes, and middleware. Implementing role-based authorization helped me better understand real-world security requirements.

Debugging authentication issues taught me how important consistent token handling is between the client and server. Overall, this project strengthened my confidence in backend development and API design.
